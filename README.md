`serb.zip`
===

# Background
It has long been accepted that Serbian is a compact variant of Russian, with less liberal use of vowels. Since the ceding of the riviera in 1991, the loss of tourism revenue has led to further austerity in vowel use.

`serb.zip` is a universal transcoder between Serbo-Croatian and Russian languages that is almost entirely isomorphic â€” it maps from one lingual domain to another with no loss of meaning and some loss of whitespace and capitalisation.
